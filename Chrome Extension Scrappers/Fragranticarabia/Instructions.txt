How is works
-------------

-> When the user visits https://www.fragranticarabia.com/, it alerts that they are on the correct site.

	Depending on the page URL (male perfumes, female perfumes, or unisex), it calls the ReviewScrapper() function.

-> Inside ReviewScrapper():

	It retrieves a manual_scrap_user_id from Chrome's local storage.

	It loops through all perfume cards found on the page (.perfumes-row .cell.card).

	For each card:

		It extracts the product's detail page URL (search_url).

		It makes an AJAX GET request to fetch the full product page HTML.

		From the fetched product page:

			It scrapes:

				Product Title
		
				Review Rating

				Reviews (Date, Author, Body, Author Image)

		It packs the scraped review information into a JSON object.

		It sends the data to your server at an endpoint like:

		https://[domain]/[path]/[Query for example ajax.php?action=fragranticarabia_reviews]

		It logs responses for debugging.

-> After scraping all products on the page:

	It clicks the "Load More" button automatically.

	After a delay (9 seconds), it recursively calls ReviewScrapper() again to scrape the newly loaded products.



Key Technical Notes:
----------------------
setTimeout is used to delay scraping per product (count starts at 9000ms and increases by 1000ms each time).

The script removes the already-scraped .cell.card elements to avoid duplicate scraping.

Recursive scraping: It scrapes, loads more, scrapes again until no more products are available.

Post data: jQuery.post sends the data to the server in JSON format.
