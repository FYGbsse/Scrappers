Description
-----------

This extension helps to automatically collect customer reviews from a perfume website and store them in a database without any manual work.
It works quietly in the background and keeps collecting information until it has gathered everything. The total scrape values are 25800.

How it works
-----------


1. Recognizing the Website
	When you open the Fragrantic Arabia website, the extension checks if you are on the right page.
	It shows a small alert message like "I am in Fragrantic Arabia" to confirm.

2. Choosing the Category
	The extension looks at the page you are on — whether it's showing perfumes for men, women, or both (unisex).
	Based on that, it decides to start collecting reviews.

3. Collecting Reviews
	The extension goes through the perfumes listed on the page, one by one.
	For each perfume, it:

		Opens the perfume's individual page behind the scenes.

		Gathers important details like:

		Perfume name

		Customer review rating

		Reviewer’s name

		Review text

		Reviewer’s profile picture

	Collects this information and prepares it to send.

4. Saving the Data
	After collecting the details, the extension sends the information securely to a database where it can be stored and used later.

5. Loading More Perfumes
	Once it collects reviews from all the perfumes on the page, the extension automatically clicks a "Load More" button to see even more perfumes.
	It then repeats the same process to gather even more reviews.

6. Repeats Until Done
The extension keeps doing this — collecting reviews, sending data, and loading more perfumes — until there are no more perfumes left to scrape.
